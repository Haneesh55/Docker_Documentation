Step 1: Create a New Test Plan
In JMeter, a Test Plan is the container for your load test. Right-click on "Test Plan" in the left panel and choose "Add" > "Threads (Users)" > "Thread Group." This is where you define the number of virtual users and their behavior.

Step 2: Configure Thread Group
Under the Thread Group, you can set the number of users (Threads), ramp-up time (how long it takes to start all users), loop count (the number of times each user repeats the test), etc.

Step 3: Add HTTP Request Defaults
Right-click on the Thread Group, go to "Add" > "Config Element" > "HTTP Request Defaults." Here, you can specify the base URL of your Tomcat application, which will be used as the default for all HTTP requests.

Step 4: Add HTTP Requests
Under the Thread Group, add "Sampler" > "HTTP Request." Configure the HTTP request with the appropriate path, method, parameters, etc., to simulate user interactions with your Tomcat application.

Step 5: Add Listeners
Listeners collect and display the test results. Right-click on the Thread Group, go to "Add" > "Listener" and choose the desired listener (e.g., "Summary Report" or "View Results Tree").

Step 6: Run the Test
Save your test plan, and then click the "Start" button (green play icon) to run the load test.
